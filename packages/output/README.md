# Theia - Output View Extension

Contributes an output widget to Theia that shows output from extensions to the user.
This output is usually comes from external commands run by the backend, e.g. `git` or language servers. 
This deserves a bit more of the user's attention than log messages. As opposed to UI messages, it tends 
to be more verbose and a does not require the user to react on it.
