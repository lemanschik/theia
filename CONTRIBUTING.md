# Contributing to Theia

Theia is a young open-source project with based on a modular architecture. One of the goals is to make sure that we can customize and enhance any Theia application through extensions.
So while the main theia repository contains some common functionality for IDE-like applications, like e.g. a file system or a navigator view, most functionality doesn't neccessarily need to be
put into the core reposuotry but can be developed separately.
